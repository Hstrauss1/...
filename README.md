Known Issues:
I understand some of the PNGS are poor for the larger combinational logic diagrams Im looking into how to improve these.
Not all the LAYOUTs are completed Im a working on these and will post them when done.

There are several ...T or ...Test files this is verification testbenches with setup DC,GND,Cap, and or Vpat basic analog blocks. These basic analog blocks I did not create they were given default to our version of Synopsys so I am not posting them.
